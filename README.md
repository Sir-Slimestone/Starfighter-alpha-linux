# Starfighter-alpha-linux
Linux releases of Starfighter-alpha

This is for alpha versions of Starfighter that were exported for Linux, these may be buggy or fail to run because I do not have a Linux system to test these with, I'm just hoping what works on Windows will work on Linux, if it doesn't, head to my discord and yell at me for be being an idiot and then tell me what's wrong!
